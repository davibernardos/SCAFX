# SCAFX: Source Code Automatic Feature eXtraction

Our implementation consists of a main file and four other libraries that were all developed by the author. 

The main file receives input from the user, manages calling the libraries and does the output. 

Among the libraries, there is one to perform the preprocessing of source codes. 

Another library extracts features from the processed database. 

Also, there is a library that concentrates machine learning implementations. 

Finally, there is a library of various utilities, such as writing files in comma-separated values format.
